R Data Visualization: Basic Graphs in ggplot
For this task, I will create graphs using ggplot2 functions by coding in R. Iâ€™ll begin with scatterplots by specifying two quantitative variables for the x- and y-axes. Normally, this would involve accepting an assignment and pulling a repo from GitHub into RStudio using New Project > Version Control and pasting the appropriate URL. However, since I face challenges using my personal computer, I may complete this work using JupyterHub, without Git tracking for now, and will seek help as needed to resolve those issues.

What I Will Do:
ðŸ”¹ I will run, modify, and share R scripts to analyze data and create meaningful visualizations.

ðŸ”¹ I will manage my project by storing and organizing code, aiming to use digital collaboration tools like GitHub for reproducibility whenever possible.

ðŸ”¹ I will create an original data visualization using the grammar of graphics with ggplot2.
